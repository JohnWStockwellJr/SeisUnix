Installation tip. If you get error messages regarding the XDR materials
you may need to install libtirpc from your Linux distribution.

John Stockwell retired from the Colorado School of Mines effective
1 Jan 2018. He continues to work with Seismic Unix. 
Please email: john.19071969@gmail.com
if you have questions, or if you want to supply bug fixes or new SU code.


Ongoing issues: The GNU people have separated the tirpc library and include
files from the main part of libgcc. These are now in a developers' package
on many systems called libtirpc.a. The TRPC materials are used for the XDR
part of the installation. GCC 2.32 seems to have the locations of the
include files in the wrong place. New users can set 
XDRFLAG =  -DSUXDR
to
XDRFLAG =
and the package should install just fine. If you have been using SU awhile
and have files in SU format, then there will be a byte swapping issue between
data made with XDR versus data made without XDR. 

Fixes:
A number of // C++ style comments have now been changed to /*... */ style
comments. This used to be just a warning, but now actually breaks the code
under GCC 2.32 and a number of other compiler warnings have been silenced.

Many thanks to Dominique Rousset for working on this.

Fixed:
su/main/amplitudes/sugain.c - fixed a but in the AGC function seen on GPR data but not apparent on seismic data
		Thanks to Dominique Rousset of the University of Pau

su/lib/getSPSfile.c - replaced // comments with  /* comments */ owing to
			a problem on CENTOS version 7.
Fortran/Vzest/vzestf.f - changed (about line 1119) to
        	character*120 fnames(2) from fnames(3)
		Thanks to Fernando Roxo da Motta
Fortran/Raytrace3d/ktime_3d_rayq.f - ERROR of argument mismatch in two 
   		locations. 
		fix: added -fallow-argument-mismatch to the 
                FFLAGS in Makefile.config_Big_Sur  this might need to
		be propagated to all of the Makefile.config_* and this
                likely takes care of the vzestf.f error as well. 

Sfio/
	Replaced these files with versions from the 2002 release of sfio.
	./src/lib/sfio/Stdio_b/sprintf.c
	./src/lib/sfio/Stdio_b/vsprintf.c
	./src/lib/sfio/Stdio_s/stdsprintf.c
        The make sfio should work now.

demos/Ordinary_differential_equations  - has been added to go with the new
	ordinary_differential equation items in par/main
