What is new in the SU package:

Restructuring: 
par/main 

is now:

par/main/cellular_automata
par/main/data_conversion
par/main/material_parameters
par/main/ordinary_differential_equations
par/main/parameter_file_utilities
par/main/plotting_utilities
par/main/ray_theory
par/main/refraction
par/main/resampling
par/main/smoothing
par/main/statistics
par/main/velocity_model_building

par/main/wavelet_transform



New:
ramac2su - converts RAMAC GPR files to su format with a nominal geometry
		Thanks to: Herv√© Perrou,d  12/2000and Dominique Rousset,  2019

configs/Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu
configs/Makefile.config_Mac_OSX_Mojave
par/main/ordinary_differential_equations
	 logisticfit.c - extract growth and carrying capacity for logistic
			 model
	 seirepidemic.c - SEIR epidemic model
	 sirepidemic.c - SIR epidemic model
	 sirdepidemic.c - SIRD epidemic model
	 voltlotka.c - classic Lotka Volterra predator-prey model
demos/Ordinary_differential_equations
	 Epidemiology
	 Logistic_Equation
	 Predator_Prey

Fixed:
sugain.c - fixed a but in the AGC function seen on GPR data but not apparent on
           seismic data
		Thanks to Dominique Rousset of the University of Pau

su/lib/getSPSfile.c - replaced // comments with  /* comments */ owing to
			a problem on CENTOS version 7.
