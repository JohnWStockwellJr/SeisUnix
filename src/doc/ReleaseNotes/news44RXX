Installation tip. If you get error messages regarding the XDR materials
you may need to install either librpc or libtirpc from your Linux distribution.
Compile time flags are now provided for either case.

1 Jan 2018. He continues to work with Seismic Unix.

if you have questions, or if you want to supply bug fixes or new SU code.


Update 23 March 2023:
Ongoing issues: The GNU people have separated the tirpc library and include
files from the main part of libgcc. These are now in a developers' package
on many systems called libtirpc.a. The TRPC materials are used for the XDR
part of the installation. There seem to be two stages of this change. The
first stage left the RPC include files in the old location. Releases 
GCC 2.32 and later have removed the rpc files and replaced them with 
a version called tirpc

In response to this issue I have added a paragraph in select 
Makefile.config near
lines 40-50.
.......
# if the include files  are under  /usr/include/rpc use this for XDR
# whether or not you had to install libtrpc.a
# make sure
XDRFLAG =  -DSUXDR
XDRLFLAGS =
XDRIFLAGS =

# else if you had to install libtirpc and the rpc include files are under
# /usr/include/tirpc/rpc or if you get an error about <types.h> not found,
#  and you want to use XDR, then make sure the next three lines are uncommented
XDRFLAG = -DSUXDR -DSUTIRPC
XDRIFLAGS = -I/usr/include/tirpc/rpc -I/usr/include/tirpc
XDRLFLAGS = -ltirpc

# else if you do not want to use XDR, uncomment the next three lines
#XDRFLAG =
#XDRLFLAGS =
#XDRIFLAGS =
.......

It has been a bit of a moving target but seems to be stabilizing now.

and the package should install just fine. If you have been using SU awhile
and have files in SU format, then there will be a byte swapping issue between
data made with XDR versus data made without XDR. You can use "suswapbytes" 
and "suoldtonew" to convert from XDR to native binay format and vice versa.

Update: Nov 2021 The following items in
src/configs/
	Makefile.config_Linux_x86_64
	Makefile.config_Linux_i686
	Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu_20.04
	Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu
	Makefile.config_Linux_Fedora_32
	Makefile.config_Linux_ARCH
	Makefile.config_MacOSX_Big_Sur
	Makefile.config_MacOSX_Catalina

have been modified with compile time flags to handle the rpc and tirpc issue
discussed above, so you can use XDR without a problem.

Fixes:
A number of // C++ style comments have now been changed to /*... */ style
comments. This used to be just a warning, but now actually breaks the code
under GCC 2.32. This and a number of other compiler warnings have been silenced.

Many thanks to Dominique Rousset for working on this.

The last tmpnam calls were removed from suedit.c and suxedit.c

Fixed:
su/main/amplitudes/sugain.c - fixed a but in the AGC function seen on GPR data but not apparent on seismic data
		Thanks to Dominique Rousset of the University of Pau

su/lib/getSPSfile.c - replaced // comments with  /* comments */ owing to
			a problem on CENTOS version 7.
Fortran/Vzest/vzestf.f - changed (about line 1119) to
        	character*120 fnames(2) from fnames(3)
		Thanks to Fernando Roxo da Motta
Fortran/Raytrace3d/ktime_3d_rayq.f - ERROR of argument mismatch in two 
   		locations. 
		fix: added -fallow-argument-mismatch to the 
                FFLAGS in Makefile.config_Big_Sur  this might need to
		be propagated to all of the Makefile.config_* and this
                likely takes care of the vzestf.f error as well. 

Sfio/
	Replaced these files with versions from the 2002 release of sfio.

	 Some people are having difficulty with this version. There is
	a gzipped tarfile of the 15 Sept 2021 version of Sfio. Try that
        one or take the Sfio directory from an older release


demos/Ordinary_differential_equations  - has been added to go with the new
	ordinary_differential equation items in par/main
