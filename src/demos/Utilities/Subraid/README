SUBRAID inputs multiple files that have the same order (such as cdp order) 
and outputs all their traces into 1 file that has the same order.
It does this by a process similar to braiding hair or braiding strands of rope.
This process only stores one trace at a time from each input file.             

SUBRAID requires that the input files have the same order, but that order
can be anything (not just cdp order). The input order can also be combinations
such as cdp,offset. The order you specify is checked on-the-fly and error-halt
will occur if input traces are not actually in that order


Note that program SUCLEAVE can be considered the opposite of this program since
it can separate 1 input file into multiple same-ordered output files.    

The tests below contain details of how they are setup, and what they are  
intended to do and show.

I suggest you review and run the SUBRAID tests in this order....

 sh ./Subraid_test1    

 sh ./Subraid_test2    

 sh ./Subraid_test3    

 sh ./Subraid_test4    

 sh ./Subraid_test5    

 sh ./Subraid_test6
