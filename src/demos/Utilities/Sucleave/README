SUCLEAVE inputs 1 file and outputs multiple files with each output containing   
a specific range of values. For instance, all traces with offset value greater
than or equal to 0 and less than 100 can be output to one file. And all traces 
greater than or equal to 100 and less than 200 can be output to another. 
And so on for all offset ranges.            

An important thing to understand is that traces are output in the same order
as they are input. So, a cdp ordered input file can be split by offset ranges
into multiple output files, and each output file is still cdp ordered.

The key does not have to be offset, it can be any key. 
So, an input file can also be separated into cdp ranges, or elevation ranges,
or static ranges, and so on.

Note that program SUBRAID can be considered the opposite of this program since
it can combine multiple same-ordered input files into 1 same-ordered output.    


The tests below contain details of how they are setup, and what they are  
intended to do and show.

I suggest you review and run the SUCLEAVE tests in this order....

 sh ./Sucleave_test1    

 sh ./Sucleave_test2    

 sh ./Sucleave_test3    

 sh ./Sucleave_test4    

 sh ./Sucleave_test5    

 sh ./Sucleave_test6    

 sh ./Sucleave_test7    

 sh ./Sucleave_test8
