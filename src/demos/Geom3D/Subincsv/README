SUBINCSV reads a 3d grid definition either via command line parameters or in a file.
It then sets the cdp key to the number of the 3d cell that contains the midpoint XYs
of the input prestack traces. This program also has a poststack option where it will
use the cdp (cell) number to update the corresponding cell centre XYs into the
trace sx,sy,gx,gy keys (where sx,sy are raw,real world XYs and gx,gy are grid XYs).
This program also has an option to produce 2d cdp numbers from point numbers.     

Most examples herein use 3d grid definitions which fit the 3d survey used in the
demos/Geom3D/Sutoolcsv and demos/Geom3D/Sugeomcsv examples.

I suggest you review and run the SUBINCSV tests in this order....
