SUGEOMCSV inputs SU traces and updates the SU key values from either
fixed-format or CSV files. This program is equally usefull and useable
for either 3D or 2D geometry loading. And also for updating values 
such as statics from fixed-format or csv files.

But most examples herein concentrate on using it for loading initial
3D land/ocean-bottom-cable geometry using a full set of SPS2 files.

This program has high-level options which "know" the standard SPS2 
and SPS1 formats (either as fixed-format files or after conversion
to CSV files via SUTOOLCSV). But this program is generic and can
update any SU key values from either fixed-format or CSV files.

The ability to use CSV files for geometry leads in the direction of
using SpreadSheets or SQL databases to by-pass the 240 byte header
limitations of SU. Basically you just have to make sure the X, S, 
and R records of SPS2 format have unique mapping values for their
equivalent SpreadSheet/SQL tables produced from the CSV files output
by SUTOOLCSV - and make sure SUGEOMCSV updates those unique mapping
values to known SU trace keys. Which fits easily within 240 bytes. 
The mapped SpreadSheet/SQL tables then essentially become external
headers to contain information that cannot fit in 240 bytes and also
allow processing of that information without reading the associated
SU seismic file. But that is an extensive concept, and further in 
the future.


Included herein are examples of the 3 SPS2 fixed-format files.
And examples of how to run SUGEOMCSV. 

But I suggest you review, and run, the SUTOOLCSV examples/tests first.
Then review and run the SUGEOMCSV tests in this order....


 sh ./Sugeomcsv_create_realistic     (must be run before next test)

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_input_realistic

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_nicerecord

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_missing

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_unrepeat

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_scalco_scalel

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_create_ufile

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_statics_and_delim

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_create_simple2d  (must be run before next test)

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_input_simple2d

 sh ./Sugeomcsv_create_duplicates


Note to programmers: If you actually change the code in sugeomcsv,
remember to run (at least) Sugeomcsv_create_realistic and
Sugeomcsv_create_simple2d to create traces BEFORE your changes.
Then compare traces after your changes.
