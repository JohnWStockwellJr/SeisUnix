SUGEOMCSV inputs SU traces and updates the SU key values from either fixed-format or CSV files.
This program is equally usefull and useable for either 3D or 2D geometry loading. 
And also for updating values such as statics from fixed-format or csv files.

But most examples herein concentrate on using it for loading initial 3D land/ocean-bottom-cable
geometry using a full set of SPS2 files.

This program has high-level options which "know" the standard SPS2 and SPS1 formats
(either as fixed-format files or after conversion to CSV files via SUTOOLCSV). 
But this program is generic and can update any SU key values from either fixed-format or CSV files.

The ability to use CSV files for geometry leads in the direction of using SpreadSheets 
or SQL databases to by-pass the 240 byte header limitations of SU. Basically you just have
to make sure the X, S, and R records of SPS2 format have unique mapping values for their
equivalent SpreadSheet/SQL tables produced from the CSV files output by SUTOOLCSV - and make
sure SUGEOMCSV updates those unique mapping values to known SU trace keys. Which fits easily
within 240 bytes. The mapped SpreadSheet/SQL tables then essentially become external headers
to contain information that cannot fit in 240 bytes and also allow processing of that
information without reading the associated SU seismic file. But that is an extensive concept, 
and further in the future.


Included herein are examples of the 3 SPS2 fixed-format files and an associated SU trace file. 
And examples of how to run SUGEOMCSV. 

But I suggest you review, and run, the SUTOOLCSV examples/tests first.
Then review and run the SUGEOMCSV tests in this order....
