
SUFLEX2D -  Duplicate Some Traces Into CDPs From Neighbouring CDPs.       

The suflex2d program is part of a set of 3 programs which were primarily
written for surveys which are usually refered to as "crooked lines". 
These 3 programs also can be used for straight, bent, or coil surveys.
The 3 programs are:

  suprofcsv - create cdp locations (coordinates) at intervals along a profile
  sunearcsv - assign traces the cdp number of the nearest cdp of a profile
  suflex2d  - duplicate traces of nearby cdps for offset bin fold requirements
              (Using the suflex2d program is not required for crooked lines,
               but it uses values that are output by sunearcsv).
 
These 3 programs are under development. Should be available end of 2022.
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Suflex2d_test1

sh ./Suflex2d_test2

sh ./Suflex2d_test3

sh ./Suflex2d_test4

sh ./Suflex2d_test5

sh ./Suflex2d_test6

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next 2 scripts must be run before the remaining in order to create data.
The first 2 scripts employ the same fake crooked line survey definition   
used elsewhere (such as demos/Geom3D/Suprofcsv and demos/Geom3D/Sunearcsv).
