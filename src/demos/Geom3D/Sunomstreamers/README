
SUNOMSTREAMERS - Nominal Geometry and 2D CDPS for Towed-Streamer Marine.       
 
 This program allows you to define a towed-streamer marine layout with   
 multiple airgun arrays (or other sources) amd multiple towed-streamers.
 This basically consists of inline and crossline offset positions as well 
 as airgun and streamer identifiers and streamer channel ranges and spacing.
 From this definition, output traces are (optionally) updated with offset, 
 sx,sy,gx,gy,cdp, and airgun and streamer sequence (grnofr and grnors keys).
 These values are nominal geometry and nominal inline cdps since they are  
 computed only from the layout definition and not any INPUT coordinates.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test0 makes an overall display of 5 shots, their 7 streamers, and midpoints.
Also read the comments in the scripts for an idea of what the tests are doing.

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test0

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test1   Must run this before some of the remaining tests.

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test2

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test3

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test4

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test5

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test6

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test7

sh ./Sunomstreamers_test8
