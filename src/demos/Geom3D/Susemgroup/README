
SUSEMGROUP - Semblance Based Structure-Oriented Smooth In Trace Groups.   
 
 This program performs semblance scanning to derive (apparent) dips in the  
 direction of offsets within cdps (or other key values). It then uses those 
 dips to align trace sample values and performs a normalized sum (which     
 reduces noise). Since the dip compensation produces locally-flat horizons  
 during summing, the result is less smearing of those horizons.            
      This program does not interpolate. No traces will be created.         
      This program can process 2D and 3D stacked data. Since interpolation  
      is often desirable for stacked data, see program susembase for that.
