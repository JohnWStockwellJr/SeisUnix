
SUPROFCSV - Input Q-file or parameters, make profile, output other Q-file.

The suprofcsv program is part of a set of 3 programs which were primarily
written for surveys which are usually refered to as "crooked lines". 
These 3 programs also can be used for straight, bent, or coil surveys.
The 3 programs are:

  suprofcsv - create cdp locations (coordinates) at intervals along a profile
  sunearcsv - assign traces the cdp number of the nearest cdp of a profile
  suflex2d  - duplicate traces of nearby cdps for offset bin fold requirements
              (Using the suflex2d program is not required for crooked lines,
               but it uses values that are output by sunearcsv).
 
These 3 programs are under development. Should be available end of 2022.
 
 
The first script herein starts from a realistic SPS2 R-file which shows the
kind of profile you want to get from suprofcsv for typical crooked surveys.
The remaining scripts are tests of the individual options.

I suggest you run these scripts in the following order.

sh ./Suprofcsv_realistic1   

---

sh ./Suprofcsv_test0      

sh ./Suprofcsv_test1      

sh ./Suprofcsv_test2      

sh ./Suprofcsv_test3      

sh ./Suprofcsv_test4      

sh ./Suprofcsv_compare01234

---

sh ./Suprofcsv_test5      

sh ./Suprofcsv_compare45

sh ./Suprofcsv_test6      

sh ./Suprofcsv_compare56
