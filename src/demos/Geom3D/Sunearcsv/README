
SUNEARCSV - Assign Trace Key Values From Nearest Q-file Record.            

You might find it interesting that the sunearcsv program includes some
kdtree find-nearest code written specifically for crooked lines which
approach-or-intersect themselves (coil surveys are an extreme example of this).

The sunearcsv program is part of a set of 3 programs which were primarily
written for surveys which are usually refered to as "crooked lines". 
These 3 programs also can be used for straight, bent, or coil surveys.
The 3 programs are:

  suprofcsv - create cdp locations (coordinates) at intervals along a profile
  sunearcsv - assign traces the cdp number of the nearest cdp of a profile
  suflex2d  - duplicate traces of nearby cdps for offset bin fold requirements 
              (Using the suflex2d program is not required for crooked lines,
               but it uses values that are output by sunearcsv).
 
These 3 programs are under development. Should be available end of 2022.
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following script creates traces from SPS2 geometry files.
This script must be run before (some of) the subsequent scripts.
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_traces

---
The following 4 scripts do not use the sunearcsv program at all,
they just show you some plots so you know what is going on...
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile

sh ./Sunearcsv_graph_XYmidpoints_of_traces                  

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_graph_all

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_graph_with_color_offsets

---
The following scripts actually assign traces to the cdp which is nearest 
the midpoint coordinates computed from the sx,sy,gx,gy trace keys.
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_assign_cdps_graph_3

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_graph_igc

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_graph_igi

sh ./Sunearcsv_shift_realistic_profile_and_graph_igi

sh ./Sunearcsv_compare78

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following script actually assigns traces to the cdp which is nearest 
the midpoint coordinates computed from the sx,sy,gx,gy trace keys 
and then proceeds with normal processing (sort,nmo,stack,display).

sh ./Sunearcsv_create_realistic_profile_and_assign_cdps_stack

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following scripts test specific option choices.  
They are not intended to be realistic...  

The following set of scripts basically:
  generate cdp profiles, 
  creates some null traces, 
  sets the coordinate keys (sx,sy,gx,gy) in those null traces,    
  then employs various options of the sunearcsv program.
Then those scripts print the cdp,igi,igc key values and
plots the locations of the profile and trace midpoints.

The plots made by the test1 to test5 scripts do not change. 
The printed values of cdp,igi,igc are what you need to look at.
The tops of the scripts echo explanations of what is being tested.

sh ./Sunearcsv_test1      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test2      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test3      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test4      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test5      

---
Scripts 6-9 test use of a third value to sort a profile, and some minor options.
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_test6      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test7      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test8      

sh ./Sunearcsv_test9      

---
Scripts 10-14_intersection test options for a profile which intersects itself.                             
Which are also options needed for coil surveys, overlapping surveys, and                                
crooked surveys in which a section of the survey gets NEAR another section.                       
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_test10_intersection

sh ./Sunearcsv_test11_intersection

sh ./Sunearcsv_test12_intersection

sh ./Sunearcsv_test13_intersection

---
Scripts a-b test some options for the range extents.                                  
---

sh ./Sunearcsv_testa

sh ./Sunearcsv_testb
