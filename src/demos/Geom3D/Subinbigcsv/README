
SUBINBIGCSV - Make Some CDPs Larger and Delete All Traces Outside Them.

Essentially, SUBINBIGCSV can act as a helper for Velocity Analysis (Velan) for 3D.
And as a helper for Mute definition for 3D.                                         
It makes super-cdps by incrementing by user-specified index intervals through the
inline and crossline indexes of a 3D Grid and renumbering adjacent cdps to the 
center cdp numbers. It also rejects all traces for cdps not adjacent to center cdps.

This produces cdp locations which fullfill the enclosing-rectangle requirements  
of SUNMOCSV, SUMUTECSV, and SUBINQCSV (for bilinear interpolation of functions).

See demos/Geom3D/Sunmocsv for details about enclosing-rectangle requirements.


The examples herein use the 3D grid definition which fits the 3D survey used in the
demos/Geom3D/Sutoolcsv and demos/Geom3D/Sugeomcsv and demos/Geom3D/Subincsv examples.

The Reject544 script deliberately deletes all traces for cdp 544 (after BigBin).
So, the remaining cdps no longer form enclosing-rectangles (as required by SUNMOCSV).
The VelanBinBig script reacts by producing a blank contour map for 544 which
you should pick anyway. One pick is best. Then look at the stkvel.p1 output
when you are finished. For an actual situation, you would then replace the
velocity function for 544 in stkvel.p1 with some reasonable function.
 
I suggest you run these tests in this order.

sh ./Subinbigcsv_test1       (this is a simple to understand 2D test)

sh ./Subinbigcsv_test2

sh ./Subinbigcsv_test3


Then, I suggest you review and run these scripts in this order.

sh ./Create3D                (must be run first to create traces)

sh ./BinBig                  (must be run second to make super-cdps)

sh ./Reject544               (must be run before the next scripts)

sh ./VelanBinBig             (this is INTERACTIVE velan picking) 

sh ./NMOandDisplay           (after velocities are picked)


sh ./VelanBinBigRandom       (this is also INTERACTIVE velan picking)


The following script performs interactive mute picking. Inputting the
trace file from Reject544 causes it to produce a dark image which you
should pick anyway. One pick is best. Then look at the mutes.p1 output
when you are finished. For an actual situation, you would then replace 
the mute function for 544 in mutes.p1 with some reasonable function.

sh ./MutanBinBig             (this is INTERACTIVE mute picking) 


Note: The interactive scripts herein are derived from
