
SUSEMBASE - Semblance Based Structure-Oriented Interpolate and Smooth.   
 
   This program performs semblance scanning to derive (apparent) dips in the  
   direction of cdp numbers (or other key values). It then uses those dips to 
   align trace sample values while performing interpolation and/or smoothing. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Susembase_test1

sh ./Susembase_test2

sh ./Susembase_test3

sh ./Susembase_test4

sh ./Susembase_test5

sh ./Susembase_test6

sh ./Susembase_test7

---

sh ./Susembase_cdp3dinline     This must be run before Susembase_cdp3dcrossline.

sh ./Susembase_cdp3dcrossline

---

sh ./Susembase_offset
