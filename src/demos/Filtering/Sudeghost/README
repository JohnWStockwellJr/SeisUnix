Sudeghost may be used either for modeling ghosts or removing ghosts

About the demo. A synthetic shot gather is generated using MakeData.
This script uses suaddevent to generate a synthetic shot gather that
is inspired by shot ep=200 in the Mobil Line 12 AVO (Viking Graben) dataset.

MakeData   -   make a synthetic shot gather 

Sudeghost.sh  -  Uses sudeghost in mode deghost=0 to put ghosts on the
          the synthetic shot gather from MakeData, using the ghosting operator
          described in Perz and Masoomzadeh (2014).  Then the deghosting
          operator is applied to remove the ghosts from the synthetic.

          Differences are applied to generate:
             ghost.su = sudiff ghost+synthetic_shot.su synthetic_shot.su
             ghost_estimate.su =  sudiff  ghost+synthetic_shot.su deghosted.su
	     residual.su =  sudiff synthetic_shot.su deghosted.su 

	Plots made:
             synthetic_shot.su 
             ghost+synthetic_shot.su
             ghost.su
             deghosted.su
             ghost_estimate.su
	     residual.su

These are plotted individually and concatenated together for comparison.
